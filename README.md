# Sort-Visualizer
A dynamic Single-Page Application built using React to visualize common sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, shell sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

## The objective of this project is
To engage users in an enjoyable learning experience about sorting algorithms. By providing interactive visualizations, I aim to illustrate the sorting process for some common algorithms, fostering understanding and curiosity.

## Purpose
To learn React and improve my JavaScript skills.
